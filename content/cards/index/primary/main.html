	Welcome to WebCards! This is a simple website using a Card layout to highlight appropriate information.<br><br>
	
	If you mouse over the card, 3 dots will show at the bottom signifying this card is large enough to be
	collapsed, and will do so on click. This card is pre-expanded, but they can also automatically be collapsed
	once reaching a max-height. You can even <a href="other#Something">link to a card on a page</a> to have it be auto-expanded
	on click.<br><br>
