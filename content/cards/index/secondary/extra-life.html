	I participated in a wonderful charity event called Extra-Life. On October 25th, 2014, I played video games for 24 straight hours in an attempt
	to raise money for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. The hospital I chose to directly support is the amazing Boston Children's Hospital.

	While the event is now over, you can still donate and help us reach our team goal.
	If you would like to help, please consider donating to one of our team members!
